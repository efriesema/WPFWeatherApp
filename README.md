# WPFWeatherApp
This was part of an online course to create a WPF app using the Accuweather API to find 5-day forecasts for any selected city
It helped to explore some key concepts about WPF application development in C# 

1) MVVM Design pattern -  Important to work with this more and see how to spearate  code and how that helps to eleiminate code behind and make code more portable
2) REST API-  fairly basic in this application but shows the basics of creating an Http LCient in C# and some bestpractices for how to use and configure it for API 
calls and then convert the JSON data into a usbale class
3) Data Binding and XAML -  powerful capabilities for XAML to use Data Binding to allow information to be shared with model while using minimal code behind
4) Interfaces- power of interfaces for allowing application to work while minimizing event handlers and other types of code-behind

Possible code imporvement
1)  Add a converter for farhenheit and Celsius  
2) Modify VIew to be mor eaesthetic
3)  Atempt to port to Xamarin application
